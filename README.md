# Overview?

Notes and sample code for concepts covered during the training period for Company C's
Data Engineering Practice.

This is ultimately for personal use so expect not perfect.

### Project Setup

Every `modules/x` will have its own environment. They may contain `setup.sh` and/or
`activate.sh` to streamline the process of setting up and activating these environments.

You may need to read and rewrite the commands for your own machine.

Usage:
```
cd modules/<name of module>
./setup.sh
source activate.sh
```

### Running the code

`.ipynb` notebooks can be easily run using the Jupyter family of extensions for VS Code.
Make sure to select the Python interpreter from your `.venv` using the VS Code UI.
